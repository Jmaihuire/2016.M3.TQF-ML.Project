Boosting Alpha Factors in Chinese A Share Stock Market

## Project Goal:
(1)	Try to use the machine learning method to boost the single factor into a multi-factor model.
(2)	Try to use the machine learning method to decrease the turnover rate of the stratedgy.

## ML methods:
(1)	Algorithm 1 : Naïve Boosting 

(2)	Algorithm 2 : Standard Boosting (Adaboosting)

(3) Algorithm 3 : Revised Boosting 

 the detailed description of these Algorithms is in the [final report]()
 
## Data Source & data description：
(1)	The basic data , i.e. stock day return , last price , high price, low price , volume etc. is downloaded from Wind database.
(2)	The single factor , which is named as ‘alphaxx’ , these single factors are generated by some un-public formulas based on basic data.

## Further work：
Use some filtering methods such as kernel or spline smoothing, wavelet or Kalman filtering to reduce the noise.
